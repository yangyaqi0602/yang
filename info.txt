杨亚琪 Amsterdam, Shanghai

Yang’s work explores the storytelling potential of design objects, emphasizing the intricate details and symbolic use of materials. From knitted scarves to psychedelic posters, she manipulates graphic components to create a personal visual language that merges the poetic with the analytical. Yang’s art challenges conventional interpretations, often using repetition and layering to evoke emotions and explore themes of transformation and identity. Her interdisciplinary approach integrates graphic design, poetry, and installation, aiming to encode subjective experiences into tangible forms that invite contemplation and reflection on life’s complexities and transformative power.
