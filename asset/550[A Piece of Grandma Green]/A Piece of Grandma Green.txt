A Piece Of Grandma Green, Ehibiton, 2024, Black And Color Yarn, Arnhem, NL

Suspended Braids, Installation, 160×120×60cm
Four black braids and one colored braid vary in thickness. Hanging reflects a gaze upon female identity. Black symbolizes Chinese women, but when asked, “Why isn’t it all black?” I replied, “Hair color changes with age, and the world holds many colors.”

Poem for grandma, Performance, 5mins
The poem forms the core of the work. I recited it in the gallery, where verses flowed through the space, creating an intimate connection with the installations.

Thread on Column, Installation, 405×8×120cm
A single long braid cascades from a column, extending from ceiling to floor. Woven with varying textures and thicknesses, it anchors the space and symbolizes an intergenerational connection linking past and present.

Hanging Braids, Installation, 135×22×80cm
Inspired by traditional practices like drying clothes, these braids evoke the rhythm of daily labor. They embody the silent strength of women’s hands and the resilience woven into life.

Dispersed Braids, installation, 5×32×25cm
Scattered on the ground like seeds, the braids take new forms, unbound yet grounded. They symbolize growth emerging from chaos.

白桥有雪，
你站在田坎遥望，
那是层层温润。

黄花菜绿了又黄，
我淌过那蜿蜒山间，
麦子璀璨，
桐子树的果实鼓鼓，
沁出白白乳汁，
那是轻快陡斜的小坡。

下山了，
鸭子们在后院交欢，
上山了，
桔树飘香。

坟头有草，
你站在田坎遥望，
那是声声炮响。

孩子们走了又来，
我乘上那乡间巴士，
你拥我簇，
夕阳下的余晖暖暖，
荡起浅浅尘埃，
那是寂静险峻的崎岖。

下山了，
菜籽花在路边轻吟，
上山了，
泥土芬芳。
