Painting, 60×85cm, 2024, Calico and Mixed Paint, Arnhem, NL

Blue explores identity, dislocation, and transformation through abstract forms and deep blue hues, symbolizing isolation, resilience, and hope. Red and white accents evoke disruption and healing, while undefined edges mirror life’s uncertainties, inviting viewers to reflect on change and belonging.
