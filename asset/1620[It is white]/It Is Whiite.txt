<i>It Is Whiite 1</i>, Installation, 130×300 cm
It is White features a tapestry of 36 white materials, exploring white as absence and possibility. Gaps in the fabric, illuminated by light, reveal white’s fragility, resilience, and infinite potential, transcending simplicity to embody texture and emotion.

<i>It Is Whiite 2</i>, Performance, 5mins
A blank scroll accompanies my recitation of It is White, where words bridge light, sound, and emotion. The poem unfolds through RGB colors, culminating in white—a unifying force that transforms absence into presence through ritual and material interplay.sound, and emotion.

<i>It Is Whiite 3</i>, Food & Drinks, 30mins
White converges material, sound, and sensation, extending beyond the tapestry to include sensory elements like white liquor and wool-like foods. Representing contradictions—emptiness and fullness—it becomes a unifying language of visible and invisible complexities.
